          individual who thrives on new experiences. I belong to this city
          called Allahabad/Prayagraj in India. I have a Bachelor's degree in
          Computer Science as well as a Master's degree in Information
          Technology with specialization in Cyber Security.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-3">"I pursue a career in..."</h2>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I have been working in the software industry for over 6 years now and have
      experience in various technologies such as Python, Django, FastAPI, React,
      Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker,
      Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and more. I have worked on various
      projects ranging from web development to cloud computing and have a keen
      interest in learning new technologies and frameworks. I am always looking
      for new opportunities to learn and grow as a software developer. In my
      spare time I like to work on personal projects, do video editing, travel
      and play video games.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-3">"Travel is the air I breathe"</h2>
    <p>
      I simply love to travel and explore new places. I have been to various
      places in India and have also traveled to Europe. I'd often take a break
      from my work and go on a trip to some new place. I believe that traveling
      is the best way to learn about different cultures, meet new people, and
      experience new things. I have a bucket list of places that I want to visit
      and I am slowly ticking them off one at a time. I aim to visit all the
      UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India and explore the beauty of nature and
      ancient architecture. I've been to 24/42 such destinations as of now.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I'd often go on solo trips and explore new places on my own. I believe
      that solo travel is the best way to learn about oneself and grow as an
      individual. At the time of writing this, I've already been to 20+ solo
      trips in my life covering 60+ cities in India.

      "I have multiple lives – in every game I play."
    </h2>
    <p>
      I love playing video games and it is one of my favorite pastimes. I have
      been playing video games since I was a kid and have played various games
      on different platforms. I enjoy playing games on PC, PS4/PS5, and Mobile.
      I have played games from various genres such as Role-Playing, Action,
      Adventure, Strategy, and Sports. I have played games like Pokemon, Call of
      Duty, FIFA, Need for Speed, GTA, Age of Empires, DOTA, Counter Strike,
      Spider Man, Last of Us, Horizon Zero Dawn and many more.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I believe gaming provides an escape from reality and lets you live
      multiple virtual lives. It is a great way to relax and unwind after a long
      day of work. I often play games with my friends and family and enjoy the
      competitive spirit that comes with it. I also enjoy watching gaming
      streams on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. I have a special liking for
      games with a good storyline and character development. I believe that
      games are a form of art and can evoke emotions and feelings just like any
      other form of art. Playing a game with a good story can be a truly
      immersive experience, it's like being part of a movie where you control
      the actions of the protagonist. Games like The Last of Us, God of War,
      Uncharted, Red Dead Redemption 2, Spider-Man, Batman and more have left a
      lasting impact on me.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-3">"Music is the essence of my spirit"</h2>
    <p>
      I love listening to music and it is an integral part of my life. I would
      often listen to instrumental music while I'm working or traveling. I
      believe that music has the power to heal and soothe the soul. I have a
      diverse taste in music and enjoy listening to various genres such as
      Classical, Jazz, Rock, and Pop. I also enjoy playing the Guitar and Piano.
      I've been learning to play those instruments for a few months now with
      little success. I am into Bollywood music especially the ones from
      2003-2013. I've grown up listening to those songs on 9XM. They are still
      part of my playlist and I often listen to them while working or traveling.
      I've a special liking for slow romantic songs. I'd often try to sing those
      and create covers of them. My favorite singers are Arijit Singh, Mohit
      Chauhan, Sonu Nigam, and Shreya Ghoshal.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I also enjoy Western Music and have a special liking for bands like
      Backstreet Boys, One Direction, Linkin Park, The Chainsmokers 3 Days Grace
      and Breaking Benjamin. My favorite singers are Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift,
      Ellie Goulding, Katy Perry, Enrique Iglesias, Shakira and more.

      "My penchant for Photography and Video editing"
    </h2>
    <p>
      I think most people who travel have a natural inclination towards
      photography. I am no different. I love capturing moments and creating
      memories through photographs. I have a keen interest in photography and
      enjoy clicking pictures of landscapes, architecture, and people. I believe
      that photography is a form of art that allows you to express yourself and
      capture the beauty of the world around you. I have a collection of
      photographs from my travels that I cherish and look back on fondly. I also
      enjoy editing photos and creating collages and albums to preserve my
      memories.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I am also into video editing and have created various videos for my
      personal projects and travel diaries. I enjoy the process of editing
      videos and adding effects and music to create a visually appealing story.
      I believe that video editing is a creative process that allows you to tell
      a story and evoke emotions through visuals and sound. I have created
      videos for my travel diaries, personal projects, and events. I enjoy
      experimenting with different editing styles and techniques to create
      unique and engaging videos. I've worked with Softwares such as Adobe
      Premiere Pro, After Effects, Wondershare Filmora and Movavi Creative Suite
      for video editing.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-3">"I ❤️ Cooking"</h2>
    <p>
      Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies and I enjoy experimenting with
      different cuisines and recipes. I believe that cooking is a form of art
      that allows you to express yourself and create something delicious from
      scratch.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I like to cook mostly Indian dishes. But, I do occasionally try my hand at
      other cuisines like Chinese and Italian. I enjoy cooking for my friends
      and family and love to see the smiles on their faces when they taste my
      food. I remember it was during the lockdown that I started cooking and
      experimenting with new recipes because we were forced to. I started with
      cooking Pizza and vegetable Pulao and since then haven't looked back. I'd
      often refer Youtube cooking channels especializing in Indian cuisine for
      new recipes and try them out. I believe that cooking is a great way to
      relax and unwind after a long day and it is a skill that everyone should
      learn. I'd often close or open my day with a cooking session.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold my-3">"Games and Sports I am into"</h2>
    <p>
      I'm pretty much average in sports but I do enjoy playing them. I have
      played Cricket, Badminton, Table Tennis, and Football. I enjoy watching
      Tennis and Football matches on TV and had been following the matches
      previously in the era of big 3. I have a special liking for Roger Federer,
      Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, in Tennis. I don't think we'd ever see 3
      players of their caliber in the same era again. I also used to regularly
      follow football when Real Madrid was at its peak with Cristiano Ronaldo,
      Kaka, Modric, Kroos, Benzema, Bale, Ramos, Marcelo, Casillas, and more.
      I've stopped following sports lately but do enjoy watching Crickt matches
      occasionally with my friends and family.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      I have also played games like Chess, Carrom, Ludo, Snakes and Ladders,
      Monopoly, and Uno. I enjoy playing board games with my friends and family
      and it is a great way to spend quality time together. I have a competitive
      spirit and enjoy the thrill of winning a game. I believe that games teach
      you important life skills such as strategy, teamwork, and sportsmanship.

      "My screen time is reserved for real life."
    </h2>
    <p class="text-gray-500">
      Everyone around me seems to love watching movies and TV shows. I am not a
      big fan of them. I'd often watch movies with my friends and family but I
      don't have a habit of watching them alone. I'd often watch movies in
      theaters with my friends and family and there would often be a big gap
      between the movies I watch. I am a big fan of Marvel and DC movies and
      have watched most of them. My favorite movies are Avengers Endgame, LOTR,
      The Dark Knight, Harry Potter Series, Inception, Good Will Hunting, The
      Shawshank Redemption, original Spider-Man .
    </p>
    <p class="mt-5">
      In bollywood I'd often watch movies which have a good storyline and
      acting. I'd really think a lot before watching a movie because I believe
      that time is precious and I don't want to waste it on something that
      doesn't add value to my life.
